## Project Description
This project demonstrates the use of Sonarqube for code static analysis in a Spring Boot application. It includes a simple Spring Boot application with a few classes and a test suite.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to showcase how to integrate Sonarqube into a Java project for code static analysis. By using Sonarqube, we can identify code quality issues, bugs, and security vulnerabilities in our codebase.

## Code Static Analysis with Sonarqube
Sonarqube is an open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality. It performs static code analysis to detect code smells, bugs, and security vulnerabilities. In this project, we have integrated Sonarqube with our build process using Maven and Travis CI.

### Steps to Run Sonarqube Analysis
1. Install Sonarqube locally or use a hosted Sonarqube instance.
2. Configure the `sonar-project.properties` file with the necessary project details.
3. Run the Sonarqube analysis using the following command:
   ```
   mvn clean org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent install sonar:sonar
   ```
4. View the analysis results on the Sonarqube dashboard.

### Sonarqube Configuration
The Sonarqube configuration is defined in the `.travis.yml` file. It includes the Sonarqube organization, branches, and authentication tokens required for the analysis.

### Example Sonarqube Issues
Here are some examples of issues that Sonarqube can detect:
- Code duplication
- Code smells
- Bugs
- Security vulnerabilities
- Code coverage

By addressing these issues, we can improve the overall quality and maintainability of our codebase.
